# About

This folder contains select exercises completed during the "Learn C#" course offered by Codecademy.

# How to run the exercises

Create a new project in Visual Studio (Console App (.NET Framework)) while naming the project according to the exercise name. Copy paste the relevant code into the relevant files. Most of the time it's enough to copy and paste the contents of the file Program.cs into the appropriate file, but sometimes you'll need to add additional classes to the project as well and name the accordingly.
